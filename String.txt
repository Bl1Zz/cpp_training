1. First Unique Character in a String
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.

int firstUniqChar(string s) {
}

2. Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
}
